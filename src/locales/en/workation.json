  "description": "Workation is a combination of work and vacation. It allows to extend the stay in second homes or vacation spots, to schedule longer trips with family or friends, all this without waiting for the vacation period since one can continue working.\n\nIn the same way, it is possible to add experiences such as surfing lessons, kite surfing, capoeira, Portuguese, percussion… or why not join a traditional samba school and live the authentic emotion of dancing and playing in Sapucaí as well as in other famous streets of Brazil! Whether you are looking for a short, medium or long workation, Brazil Sensations is ready to help you find the best place for your stay.",
